# Pluf Web Application Installer

Pluf framework need a DBMS, configuration and URL to run. But it is hard to run Pluf for the first time. This is a full featured application to install Pluf framework.



I will try to build it as generic and simple as possible.
So it will hopefully fit every ones needs.

For testing purpose and as inspiration i will take the SilverStripe CMS install script.
If you think i missed something or do it wrong send me a message!
